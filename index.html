        <h2>Hello</h2>
        <p>
          I'm Aditya, a rising junior at the Institute of Engineering and technology, majoring in Computer Science and

          Currently, I'm into doing my own side projects, like Machine learing project inspired by Aladdin software and contributing to the opensource projects.

          including Python, C/C++, Data Structure and Algorithms,  Machine learing, Django, Flask, Git/Github, HTML/CSS/JAVASCRIPT, java.
          Moreover, I actively take part in the Hackathon, where I'm engaging in various projects
          involving HTML/CSS, Java, Python, Machine learning, SQL, and Express, further honing my
          skills and knowledge.
          I'm enthusiastic about leveraging my technical expertise and language proficiency to drive innovative
          solutions and contribute to the growth of cutting-edge companies in the industry. Let's connect and explore
          exciting opportunities together!
